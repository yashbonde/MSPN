## This Version

This repo simply makes a training and testing these models easy by removing duplicate code and fixing things here and there. To run an example simply do:
```
python3 test.py --image https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/02/gettyimages-1058306908-0b38ff8a90d7bf88fea3133d8b72498665f63e12.jpg

## Introduction
This is a pytorch realization of MSPN proposed in [ Rethinking on Multi-Stage Networks for Human Pose Estimation ][1]. In this work, we design an effective network MSPN to fulfill human pose estimation task.

Existing pose estimation approaches fall into two categories: single-stage and multi-stage methods. While multistage methods are seemingly more suited for the task, their performance in current practice is not as good as singlestage methods. This work studies this issue. We argue that the current multi-stage methodsâ€™ unsatisfactory performance comes from the insufficiency in various design choices. We propose several improvements, including the single-stage module design, cross stage feature aggregation, and coarse-tofine supervision.

The resulting method establishes the new state-of-the-art on both MS COCO and MPII Human Pose dataset, justifying the effectiveness of a multi-stage architecture.

### Model
Download ImageNet pretained ResNet-50 model from [Google Drive][6], and put it into **$MSPN_HOME/lib/models/**. For your convenience, We also provide a well-trained 2-stage MSPN model for COCO.
